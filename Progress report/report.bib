abstract={The increased bandwidth made available to consumers in the past decade has enabled the spread of Massively Multi-user Virtual Environments (MMVEs). MMVEs require fast and frequent updates to be delivered to a considerable number of users. To address these difficult requirements, developers resort to network architectures tightly coupling clients and servers. While providing a good enough quality of experience, these architectures often compromise scalability and fault tolerance, and limit the design of user interactions and gameplay. To gain scalability and fault tolerance back, we investigate the possibility of developing MMVEs using the REST principles. Our theoretical and experimental results show that MMVEs can be built in a REST style, providing that new data management systems are developed.},

annote={Research into the feasability of using RESTful arcitecture for MMO games. I found a lot of details about current solutions as well as how they thought REST could be a suitable alternative. The calculations included in this paper are a good starting point to help decide if this is suitable on low bandwidth mobile devices. I would be interested in taking this information and seeing how and if it could be applied to mobile devices. }}
