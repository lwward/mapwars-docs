MapWars is the culmination of an investigation into the feasibility of creating a location-aware, multi-player \gls{rts} game for a mobile platform. Consideration about which platform to support is presented with the final decision being to focus on Google's Android operating system.

The game combines strategic game play against multiple players in a persistent environment, where game play is based on map of Earth and users are restricted in game to their real world location. Giving each user the capability to create their own army and battle against other players within their local area.

At the same time consideration was made to protect each users privacy and create a fair gaming experience. Thus different techniques on how to prevent crafted requests designed to circumnavigate limits placed in the Android client.
