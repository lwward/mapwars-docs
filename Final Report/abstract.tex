MapWars is the culmination of an investigation into the feasibility of creating a location-aware, multi-player \gls{rts} game for mobile platforms. Combing strategic game play against multiple players in a persistent environment, where game play is based on map of Earth and users are restricted in game to their real world location. Giving each user the capability to create their own army and battle against other players within their local area. Consideration while protecting each users privacy.
