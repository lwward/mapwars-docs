I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Reyer Zwiggelaar for agreeing to be my supervisor and for offering advice and guidance when it was sort. I would also like to thank both Reyer and Neal Snooke for their invaluable feedback on both my progress report and demonstration. These comments helped me understand the problems I was facing, what was going well and crucially where things could be improved.

Also thank you to Peter Maynard and Anika Rusnakova for their motivation and continued interest in my project. An extra thanks to Peter for his \LaTeX \hspace{1mm}expertise and listening to my disjointed reasoning.
