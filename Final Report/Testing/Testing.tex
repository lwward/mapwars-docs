stuff here please

\section{Client Testing}
\subsection{User Interface Testing}
The Android SDK comes bundled with a number of automated user interface testing tools\footnote{http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing\_ui.html}. These functional tests allow for automated testing of component behaviour as well as responding correctly to user actions. This projects interface contained very few components that actually performed very little functionality. One possible candidate for such testing could have been the map views response to using the zoom controls. This however was considered to trivial, along with any other possible test cases, that the time was not invested to automate this process. These functionalities however formed a key role in using the application so would have been quickly picked up by both developer interaction and manual testing.

\section{Server Testing}
\subsection{Automated Testing}
While developing portions of the server program it would have been impractical to use the production client as a primary testing tool. For this reason a small testing suite was created in Python which can be seen in Appendix \ref{server_testing}. This tool create an easy to use command line interface program that could impersonate a natively running Android client.
