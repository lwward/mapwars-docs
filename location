GPS Location Shiz

Multiple services
GPS, network towers, Wi-Fi
Each have different trade-offs ... accuracy, speed, battery
Movement requires re-estimation of location often and may require you to change service
It is not always the most recent that is the most accurate, sometimes sources that are a few seconds older are still more accurate
